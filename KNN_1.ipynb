        "\n",
        "1. Cross-Validation: Split the data into training and validation sets. For each candidate value of K, run the KNN algorithm on the training data and validate it against the validation set. Evaluate the performance (accuracy, F1-score, etc.) of different K values and choose the one that provides the best result on the validation set.\n",
        "2. Odd vs. Even Values of K: It's generally recommended to use odd values of K to avoid ties in classification. For example, if K = 4, you could end up with a tie (2 neighbors of one class and 2 of another). An odd value of K avoids this issue.\n",
        "3. K Based on Dataset Size: In general, smaller values of K can lead to more complex models (higher variance) because the prediction is strongly influenced by the nearest neighbors. This can result in overfitting to noise in the data. Larger values of K create smoother, more generalized models (higher bias) by averaging over more neighbors. This can lead to underfitting if K is too large.\n",
        "4. Domain-Specific Considerations: Sometimes, the choice of K can be guided by the problem domain. K = 1 might work well in problems where each class has a distinct, well-separated distribution, like in some medical diagnoses. K = 5 or 7 might be better in real-world scenarios where classes overlap, as it smooths the decision boundary.\n",
        "5. Weighted KNN: Sometimes, the choice of K can be combined with weighting the neighbors based on their distance to the query point. For example, closer neighbors can be given higher weight. This reduces the impact of a larger K because the closest points still have the most influence."

        "- As the number of dimensions increases, the volume of the space grows exponentially, which makes data points spread out or sparse. For KNN to function effectively, it requires nearby points (neighbors) to make predictions. But in high dimensions, even with a large amount of data, the points can become too far apart, making it difficult to find enough neighbors for a reliable prediction.\n",
        "- In high dimensions, KNN can become more prone to overfitting because it becomes sensitive to noisy or irrelevant features. If many features are irrelevant to the prediction task, they can distort the distance metric, leading to poor performance.\n",
