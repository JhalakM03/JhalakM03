    "\n",
    "Descriptive Statistics: The data is summarized and interpreted and explained in this type of statistics. The data is summarized from a population sample using factors such as mean and standard deviation. This summary typically includes measures such as central tendency (e.g., mean, median, mode), dispersion (e.g., range, variance, standard deviation), and shape of the distribution.\n",
    "Eg. Exam Scores Suppose you have the following scores of 20 students on an exam:\n",
    "[85, 90, 75, 92, 88, 79, 83, 95, 87, 91, 78, 86, 89, 94, 82, 80, 84, 93, 88, 81]\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: 88.5\n",
    "Median: 86\n",
    "Mode: 88\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential statistics: It is a branch of statistics that involves making inferences or predictions about a population based on a sample of data taken from that population. The main goal of inferential statistics is to draw conclusions about a population by analyzing a representative subset of that population.\n",
    "Eg. A drug test on a sample of population of different age groups in this method inferential statistics works.\n",

The scales of measurement describe the nature and different categories of information collected in a study. There are four common scales of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Nominal scale of measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "The nominal scale of measurement defines the identity property of data. This scale has certain characteristics, but doesn’t have any form of numerical meaning. The data can be placed into categories but can’t be multiplied, divided, added or subtracted from one another. Eg. Eye color, gender, country of birth.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ordinal scale of measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "The ordinal scale defines data that is placed in a specific order. While each value is ranked, there’s no information that specifies what differentiates the categories from each other. These values can’t be added to or subtracted from.\n",
    "Eg. satisfaction reviews in survey, educational degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Interval scale of measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "The interval scale contains properties of nominal and ordered data, but the difference between data points can be quantified. This type of data shows both the order of the variables and the exact differences between the variables. They can be added to or subtracted from each other, but not multiplied or divided. This scale is also characterised by the fact that the number zero is an existing variable. In the ordinal scale, zero means that the data does not exist. In the interval scale, zero has meaning – for example, if you measure degrees, zero has a temperature. Eg. credit scores, calender years.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Ratio scale of measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "Ratio scales of measurement include properties from all four scales of measurement. The data is nominal and defined by an identity, can be classified in order, contains intervals and can be broken down into exact value. Weight, height and distance are all examples of ratio variables. Data in the ratio scale can be added, subtracted, divided and multiplied.\n",
    "Eg. height, weight, calculating shares."

    "\n",
    "Understanding the level of measurement of data is crucial in statistics because it determines the types of statistical analyses that can be appropriately applied to the data. The level of measurement indicates the nature and quality of the information provided by a variable, and it influences the statistical operations and inferences that can be made.\n",

    "In analyzing survey responses on \"Satisfaction with a Product,\" the level of measurement plays a crucial role in guiding statistical analyses and interpretation. In analyzing survey responses on \"Satisfaction with a Product,\" the level of measurement plays a crucial role in guiding statistical analyses and interpretation. \n",
    "Interval or ratio data, with consistent intervals and potential zero points, may benefit from parametric tests. Descriptive statistics, such as frequencies, medians, means, and standard deviations, are selected based on the level of measurement. Understanding these distinctions ensures appropriate statistical approaches, accurate reporting of findings, and meaningful interpretations tailored to the nature of the survey data."

    "2.Nominal data is qualitative or categorical data, while Ordinal data is considered “in-between” qualitative and quantitative data.\n",
    "3.Nominal data do not provide any quantitative value, and you cannot perform numeric operations with them or compare them with one another. However, Ordinal data provide sequence, and it is possible to assign numbers to the data. No numeric operations can be performed. But ordinal data makes it possible to compare one item with another in terms of ranking.  \n",

The box plot provides a visual summary of the distribution of a dataset, showing the minimum, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and maximum values. The \"whiskers\" extend from the box to the minimum and maximum values, and the box represents the interquartile range (IQR) between Q1 and Q3.\n",
