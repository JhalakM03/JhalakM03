    "A Decision Tree Classifier is a machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It builds a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules derived from the data features. The decision tree algorithm splits the data into subsets based on the values of the input features, forming a tree-like structure where each node represents a decision based on a feature, and each branch represents an outcome of that decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working of decision tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Root Node: This is the topmost node of the tree and represents the entire dataset. It’s where the first decision is made based on the most significant feature.\n",
    "- Decision Nodes: These are the internal nodes of the tree where the dataset is split based on certain conditions of the features. Each decision node represents a test on an attribute (feature) and leads to further branching.\n",
    "- Leaf Nodes: These are the terminal nodes at the bottom of the tree where no further splitting is possible. Each leaf node represents a class label (the output) and contains the prediction for that class.\n",
    "- The decision tree algorithm decides where to split the data at each node using a specific criterion, such as Gini impurity or information gain (based on entropy). These criteria measure how well a feature separates the classes in the data.\n",
    "- Gini Impurity: Measures the frequency at which any element of the dataset would be misclassified if it were randomly labeled according to the distribution of labels in the dataset. A Gini Impurity of 0 indicates perfect classification.\n",
    "- Information Gain: Measures the reduction in entropy (uncertainty) after a dataset is split on an attribute. Higher information gain indicates a better feature for splitting.\n",
    "- The algorithm starts at the root node and evaluates all possible splits for each feature to determine the best one based on the chosen criterion (e.g., the one that provides the highest information gain). The dataset is then split into subsets based on this best feature, and the process is repeated recursively for each subset at the next level of the tree.\n",
    "- The recursive splitting continues until one of the stopping criteria is met, such as: Maximum Depth, Minimum Samples per Leaf and Pure Node.\n",
    "- Once the tree is fully grown, it can be used to make predictions on new data. To make a prediction, the algorithm starts at the root node and traverses the tree by following the decisions (splits) at each node, based on the input feature values. The path leads to a leaf node, which contains the predicted class label."

    "1. Feature Selection and Splitting Criteria: The first key step in building a decision tree is to select the best feature to split the data. The goal is to split the data in a way that maximizes the separation between classes. The mathematical intuition behind this involves measures like Gini Impurity and Information Gain.\n",

This recursive partitioning continues until one of the stopping criteria is met (e.g., maximum depth, minimum samples per node, or pure nodes).\n",
    "\n",

    "A decision tree is a type of supervised learning algorithm that is commonly used in machine learning to model and predict outcomes based on input data. It is a tree-like structure where each internal node tests on attribute, each branch corresponds to attribute value and each leaf node represents the final decision or prediction. The decision tree algorithm falls under the category of supervised learning.\n",

    "The process of forming a decision tree involves recursively partitioning the data based on the values of different attributes. The algorithm selects the best attribute to split the data at each internal node, based on certain criteria such as information gain or Gini impurity.

It starts with a dataset where each example (row) consists of several features (columns) and a target variable that has two possible classes (e.g., 0 or 1). With identifying relevant features that could influence the decision, These features become the input for the decision tree. \n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree algorithm chooses the best feature to split the data at the root node. This choice is based on criteria like Gini Impurity or Information Gain. The algorithm recursively splits each subset of data created by the previous split. At each node, it evaluates all features and selects the one that best separates the data into the two classes. The recursive splitting continues until a stopping criterion is met. At this point, the data in each node is predominantly of one class, and these terminal nodes are called leaf nodes. For any new data point, the decision tree classifier starts at the root node and traverses down the tree based on the feature values of the data point. Once it reaches a leaf node, it assigns the class label associated with that node.\n",

    "To avoid overfitting (where the model becomes too complex and captures noise in the data), pruning techniques can be applied. This involves trimming the tree to remove branches that add little value. After training the decision tree, the model is evaluated on a separate test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or AUC-ROC, which are particularly useful in binary classification. Once trained and evaluated, the decision tree model can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data. The model classifies each new instance by traversing the tree from the root to a leaf node. "

    "The geometric intuition behind a decision tree classifier involves visualizing how the algorithm divides the feature space into distinct regions that correspond to different class labels.

These boundaries help the decision tree make predictions by identifying which region a new data point falls into.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a classification problem with two features, the data points can be plotted in a 2D space, where each point represents an instance with its coordinates corresponding to the feature values. The decision tree algorithm creates splits (or decision nodes) that correspond to axis-aligned lines in this feature space. Each split divides the space into two regions, one for each possible outcome based on the feature being split on.\n",

All points within a region are predicted to belong to the same class.\n",

    "To make a prediction for a new data point, the decision tree algorithm starts at the root node and follows the path defined by the splits, checking the data point's feature values against the decision boundaries. Each decision in the tree corresponds to moving from one region of the feature space to another, based on the data point’s features. Eventually, the path leads to a leaf node, which corresponds to a specific region of the feature space. n a 2D space, you can visualize the decision tree's process as cutting the plane with vertical and horizontal lines. Each line corresponds to a split on a feature, and each resulting rectangle represents a decision region where all points within it share the same predicted class.\n",

    "The geometric intuition behind decision tree classification involves visualizing how the tree splits the feature space into distinct regions, each corresponding to a class label. By creating axis-aligned decision boundaries, the algorithm divides the space into regions where all data points in a region are predicted to belong to the same class. When making predictions, the decision tree places new data points into these regions by checking their feature values against the decision boundaries. This approach allows decision trees to handle complex classification tasks with intuitive and interpretable decision rules."
