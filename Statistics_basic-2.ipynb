    "The mean, also known as the arithmetic average, is calculated by summing all the values in the dataset and dividing by the total number of values. It is sensitive to extreme values (outliers) in the dataset because it considers every value in the calculation. The mean is most appropriate for symmetrically distributed data without significant outliers.\n",

    "The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in the dataset. It is not affected by extreme values or outliers because it only considers the frequency of values. Unlike the mean and median, the mode can be used for any type of distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The median is the middle value of a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. If the dataset has an odd number of values, the median is the middle value. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is less affected by extreme values or outliers compared to the mean because it is based on the position of values rather than their magnitude. The median is particularly useful for skewed distributions or datasets with outliers."

The easiest way to check if a variable has a skewed distribution is to plot it in a histogram. In a distribution with zero skew, the mean and median are equal. A distribution can have right (or positive), left (or negative), or zero skewness. A right-skewed distribution is longer on the right side of its peak, and a left-skewed distribution is longer on the left side of its peak."

The few high-value outliers on the right side of the distribution can significantly increase the mean, pulling it further to the right.

Therefore, in a right-skewed distribution, the position of the median is typically to the left of the mean."
