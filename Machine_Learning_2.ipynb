    "\n",
    "A statistical model or a machine learning algorithm is said to have underfitting when a model is too simple to capture data complexities. It represents the inability of the model to learn the training data effectively result in poor performance both on the training and testing data. In simple terms, an underfit model’s are inaccurate, especially when applied to new, unseen examples. It mainly happens when we uses very simple model with overly simplified assumptions. To address underfitting problem of the model, we need to use more complex models, with enhanced feature representation, and less regularization.\n",

    "Techniques to Reduce Underfitting:\n",
    "- Increase model complexity.\n",
    "- Increase the number of features, performing feature engineering.\n",
    "- Remove noise from the data.\n",
    "- Increase the number of epochs or increase the duration of training to get better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "A statistical model is said to be overfitted when the model does not make accurate predictions on testing data. When a model gets trained with so much data, it starts learning from the noise and inaccurate data entries in our data set. And when testing with test data results in High variance. Then the model does not categorize the data correctly, because of too many details and noise. The causes of overfitting are the non-parametric and non-linear methods because these types of machine learning algorithms have more freedom in building the model based on the dataset and therefore they can really build unrealistic models. \n",

    "Q2: How can we reduce overfitting? Explain in brief.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, capturing noise or random fluctuations in the data rather than the underlying patterns. This results in poor generalization to unseen data. Here are some common techniques to reduce overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cross-Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cross-validation techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation, split the dataset into multiple subsets (folds).\n",
    "- The model is trained on different combinations of training and validation sets to assess its performance on unseen data.\n",
    "- This helps evaluate the model's ability to generalize to new examples and detect overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Regularization:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization, add a penalty term to the loss function during training.\n",
    "- The penalty discourages overly complex models by penalizing large parameter values.\n",
    "- This prevents the model from fitting the training data too closely and helps improve its generalization ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Feature Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature selection techniques aim to reduce the number of input features to the model.\n",
    "- Removing irrelevant or redundant features can simplify the model and reduce the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "- Techniques include univariate feature selection, recursive feature elimination, and feature importance ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Early Stopping:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Early stopping involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation set during training.\n",
    "- Training is halted when the validation error starts to increase, indicating that the model is starting to overfit.\n",
    "- This prevents the model from continuing to learn from noise in the data and helps find the optimal point to stop training.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Data Augmentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data augmentation techniques increase the size and diversity of the training dataset by creating synthetic examples.\n",
    "- Techniques such as rotation, translation, scaling, and adding noise introduce variations to the data.\n",
    "- This helps the model learn robust patterns and reduces its reliance on specific training examples."

    "Bias-Variance Tradeoff:\n",
    "    The bias-variance tradeoff describes the relationship between bias and variance in machine learning models. It suggests that there is a tradeoff between bias and variance: reducing bias typically increases variance, and vice versa. A model with high bias tends to have low variance, while a model with high variance tends to have low bias. The goal is to find the right balance between bias and variance to minimize the overall error of the model on unseen data. The optimal model achieves a balance between bias and variance, capturing the true underlying patterns in the data without overfitting or underfitting.\n",

    "- Feature importance: Examining the importance of individual features can help identify whether the model is overfitting or underfitting. If a large number of features are deemed important, the model may be overfitting, while if only a few features are important, the model may be underfitting.\n",
