    "Multithreading is a concurrent execution technique in which multiple threads (smaller units of a process) within a single process run independently and share the same resources, such as memory space. Each thread performs a specific task, and multiple threads can execute concurrently, potentially improving the performance and responsiveness of a program.\n",
    "Multithreading can be used to achieve parallelism, where multiple threads perform tasks simultaneously. This is particularly useful in tasks that can be broken down into smaller, independent subtasks.\n",
    "Python provides a built-in threading module for working with threads. "

    "1. activeCount() : The activeCount() method is used to get the current number of active threads in a Python program. It is part of the threading module in Python. It returns an integer representing the number of Thread objects currently alive. This count includes both the main thread and any other threads you've created.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. currentThread(): is a method provided by the threading module in Python for working with multithreading. It is used to obtain a reference to the currently executing thread. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. enumerate() : It is a built-in Python function used to iterate over an iterable (e.g., a list, tuple, or string) while keeping track of the item's index. It returns a tuple containing the index and the item from the iterable. In the context of multithreading, you can use enumerate() to iterate over a list of threads or other objects while keeping track of their indices."

When you create a custom thread class by subclassing threading.Thread, you can override the run() method to define what the thread should do when it's started.\n",
    "2. start() : In multithreading, start() is a method that you call on a thread object to initiate the execution of the thread's code in parallel with other threads. It starts a new thread and runs the target function or method concurrently. \n",
    "3. join() : In multithreading, the join() method is a way to ensure that a specific thread has completed its execution before the main program or another thread proceeds. When you call join() on a thread, the program will wait until that thread has finished its work. This is particularly useful when you need to coordinate the execution of multiple threads and make sure one thread completes before others continue or before your program exits.\n",
    "4. isAlive() : The isAlive() method is used to check whether a thread is currently running or has completed its execution. It returns True if the thread is active and running, and False if the thread has finished its execution (terminated)."
