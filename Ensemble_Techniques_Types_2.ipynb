        "Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) is a powerful ensemble method that reduces overfitting in decision trees by combining the predictions of multiple independent models (typically decision trees) trained on different subsets of the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Decision trees are highly flexible and can easily overfit the training data, especially when deep trees are used. This means that the tree learns not only the underlying patterns but also the noise in the data, resulting in high variance (i.e., sensitivity to fluctuations in the training data).\n",
        "\n",
        "By using multiple decision trees trained on different bootstrap samples, the variability of individual trees is averaged out. Some trees might overfit certain parts of the data, but others may not. When the predictions of all the trees are combined (through averaging or majority voting), the overall variance is reduced, leading to a more stable and generalized model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bagging helps smooth out the predictions of individual trees, which might otherwise be overly sensitive to outliers or noisy data points. Since each tree is trained on a different subset of the data, noisy or outlier observations in one bootstrap sample are less likely to dominate the final prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "In standard decision trees, pruning is often used to avoid overfitting by limiting the depth of the tree or removing branches that are not supported by enough data. In contrast, with bagging, overfitting is reduced without the need for pruning.\n",
        "\n",
        "In bagging, each decision tree is trained on a slightly different subset of the data, which means the trees are less correlated with each other. Overfitting is typically reduced when models are less correlated because the \"mistakes\" of one tree are less likely to be repeated by other trees."

        "  High-bias models have a strong assumption about the relationship between features and the target variable. They tend to underfit the data because they are too simplistic and unable to capture complex patterns. These models typically have low variance, meaning their predictions are relatively stable across different samples of the data.\n",
        "\n",

Bagging might help further reduce variance but does not address the low-bias issue. The overall benefit might be limited and depends on how well the complex model handles variance."
