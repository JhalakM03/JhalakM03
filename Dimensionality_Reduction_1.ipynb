By plotting the cumulative explained variance against the number of components, we can select the minimum number of components that capture a high percentage of the variance (e.g., 90% or 95%). Scree Plot: This plot shows the explained variance per component. An \"elbow\" in the plot (where the curve starts to flatten) can indicate a good cutoff point.\n",

Then, select the number of dimensions that yields the best performance or a good balance of performance and efficiency.\n",
