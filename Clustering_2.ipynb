At each step, the two closest clusters are merged based on a chosen similarity or distance metric, such as single linkage (minimum distance), complete linkage (maximum distance), average linkage, or Ward's method (which minimizes variance). This merging process continues iteratively until all data points form a single cluster or until a predefined number of clusters is reached.\n",

The results are often represented using a dendrogram, a tree-like diagram that visually illustrates the merging process and the relationships between clusters.\n",

        "2. Divisive hierarchical clustering: It is a top-down approach. It begins by treating the entire dataset as a single cluster. At each step, this cluster is split into smaller clusters based on a measure of dissimilarity. The splitting process continues iteratively until each data point forms its own cluster or until a stopping criterion is met, such as a desired number of clusters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Divisive clustering provides a more granular view of how a dataset can be broken down into subgroups. However, it is computationally more expensive than the agglomerative approach, as splitting decisions require evaluating all possible partitions of a cluster.\n",

        "In summary, while both types of hierarchical clustering aim to create a hierarchy of clusters, agglomerative clustering starts with individual points and merges them, making it more computationally efficient and commonly used. Divisive clustering starts with the entire dataset and splits it iteratively, offering a detailed top-down decomposition but at a higher computational cost."

        "3. Cosine Distance (1 - Cosine Similarity): Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, focusing on their orientation rather than magnitude. It is useful for text data or high-dimensional sparse data.\n",
        "4. Minkowski Distance: Generalizes both Euclidean and Manhattan distances by using a parameter p. When p=2, it is Euclidean distance; when p=1, it is Manhattan distance.\n",
