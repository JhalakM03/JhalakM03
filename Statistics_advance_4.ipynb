This means that the researcher concludes that there is a significant effect or difference between two groups when in reality there is not. The probability of making a Type I error is denoted as alpha (α) and is set by the researcher prior to conducting the test. A smaller alpha level means a lower probability of making a Type I error.\n",

This means that the researcher concludes that there is no significant effect or difference between two groups when in reality there is.

    "Type I error: Suppose a company produces a batch of 10,000 pens and claims that the average weight of each pen is 5 grams. A researcher randomly selects a sample of 50 pens and finds that the average weight is 5.2 grams with a standard deviation of 0.5 grams. The researcher conducts a hypothesis test with a significance level of 0.05 and concludes that the average weight of the pens is significantly greater than 5 grams. However, in reality, the average weight of the pens is actually 5 grams, and the researcher has made a Type I error by rejecting the null hypothesis.\n",

    "Type II error: Consider a clinical trial testing the effectiveness of a new drug for treating a certain disease. The null hypothesis is that the drug has no effect on the disease, while the alternative hypothesis is that the drug does have an effect. If the clinical trial fails to reject the null hypothesis, it could be due to the drug having no effect, or it could be due to a Type II error, where the drug actually does have an effect but it was not detected in the study. In this scenario, a Type II error would occur if the new drug is effective, but the clinical trial fails to detect its effectiveness due to a small sample size or other limitations of the study."
